The Louisiana National Guard was deployed by the Governor of Louisiana to assist local law enforcement in the massive response to the prolonged flooding event. These operations included evacuations, search and rescue, distribution and supply of water and meals, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags and sandbag filling machines. In addition, 36 high water vehicles and 16 boats were called in to assist in the effort. Numerous roads were closed during the height of the storm across Union Parish. Numerous high water rescues were conducted by first responders which included rescuing occupants trapped in their vehicles as well as the rescuing of residents from flooded homes across the parish. Lake D'Arbonne in Union Parish rose and crested to 88.89 feet on March 11th which is the second highest crest ever recorded.  This resulted in severe flooding of both stilted and unstilted homes. Numerous boathouses were submerged. Nearly all access roads to the lake were cut off and travel by boat was the only practical method of transportation.  The Governor's Office of Homeland Security determined that upwards of 500 homes across Union Parish were completely flooded with 630 homes having registered some sort of flood damage from the 5-day event. Public property damage estimates were in excess of 3 million dollars.  Several Red Cross shelters were set up across the parish for flooded residents.

At the Cape Girardeau river gage, the river crested at a new record of 48.86 feet on the evening of New Year's Day. The old record was 48.49 feet, which was set in August of 1993. Records at Cape Girardeau go back at least a century. The 2016 crest would likely have been higher if there had not been a levee break in Alexander County, Illinois. Flood stage at Cape Girardeau is 32 feet. The estimated acreage that was flooded was 24,000 acres, of which 17,000 was cropland. Much of the flooded acreage was in the diversion channel floodplain, which extends from Allenville east to Dutchtown and Scott City. Numerous roads were flooded, including Highway 74. Dozens of residences were inaccessible due to flooding. A number of businesses and homes were flooded, including about twenty homes and eight businesses in the city of Cape Girardeau. These homes and businesses were mainly in the Red Star neighborhood of Cape Girardeau and on the south side of the city near Highway 74. Firefighters rescued a man and his dog from one of the homes. A voluntary evacuation advisory was issued for the community of Allenville, which was completely surrounded by water. Flood walls and levees protect most of the city of Cape Girardeau. These structures held up during this record flood.

The Louisiana National Guard was deployed by the Governor of Louisiana to assist local law enforcement in the massive response to the prolonged flooding event. These operations included evacuations, search and rescue, distribution and supply of water and meals, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags and sandbag filling machines. In addition, 36 high water vehicles and 16 boats were called in to assist in the effort. Numerous roads were closed during the height of the storm across Red River Parish. Numerous high water rescues were conducted by first responders which included rescuing occupants trapped in their vehicles as well as the rescuing of residents from flooded homes across the parish. Flooding was significant for residents along the Red River once again in Red River Parish where high water was experienced just 9 months earlier.  The Red River in Coushatta rose and crested at 36.87 feet on March 16th.  At this level, Louisiana Highway 480 (Red Oak Road) was flooded and closed south of Coushatta with water over the road and a bridge.  Also Louisiana Highway 515 was closed due to backwater flooding from the Red River into Loggy Bayou in both Bossier and Red River Parishes.  The Governor's Office of Homeland Security determined that upwards of 20 homes across Red River Parish were completely flooded with 57 homes having registered some sort of flood damage from the 5-day event. Public property damage estimates were still pending at the time of this writing. Several Red Cross shelters were set up across the parish for flooded residents.

Due to its non-supercell status, it will be referred to as a landspout, but is in the family of tornados.||Friday evening, 22 April, the Monterey WFO WCM was informed by a local TV meteorologist of a video posted to facebook showing a possible tornado or dust devil. The video was posted by and on the KRKC, Greenfield radio station, facebook page. Through the course of the evening of the 22nd and morning of the 23rd, the MTR WCM and WFO staff continued investigation through following up with the reporting TV meteorologist and reaching out to KRKC via facebook and email. By Saturday morning the 23rd the address and point of contact at the storm location was obtained and a storm survey was initiated.||The WFO MTR WCM was dispatched Saturday morning to perform a storm survey. The storm survey was done through the use of the Damage Assessment Toolkit (DAT) on the office iPad. Interviews were also conducted of eyewitnesses as part of the survey.|The visual survey was done with the help of an eyewitness who described where the landspout began, the path it took, damage it inflicted, and provided the visual confirmation of rotation. According to multiple accounts, the landspout began on the hillside NW of a small farm community, laying nearly flat a broad oak tree. As the landspout moved down the hill it likely went through a period of vortex stretching, allowing it to tighten up and spin a bit faster. Eyewitnesses say the landspout moved down off the hill and toward several small houses. It displaced two normal sized steel dumpsters about 30 yards in the direction of its travel. Along this flat land portion of the path the landspout encountered two oak trees, tearing off several large branches (3in diameter) and depositing them 20-30 yards away in a downpath direction. Damage assessment indicates the landspout weakened significantly while passing over several small housing structures and brushing by a barn. Once past these structures it encountered another downhill slope and re-intensified. The landspout then encountered a pole barn with a small to moderate size trailer parked beneath. There were no visible signs of damage to the trailer, but the pole barn showed significant roof damage. It is estimated that about half of the roof from the pole barn was damaged or torn off with this debris strewn about the area. Rotation is easily confirmed due to debris locations. Parts of the roof were thrown orthogonally to the right of the direction of movement, as far as 40 to 50 yards. Other portions of the roof were lifted up, taken with the landspout and scattered across a neighboring vineyard. The farthest deposit away from the pole barn is estimated at about 60 to 80 yards, along the landspout path to the southeast. Eyewitness video posted on KRKC facebook page shows the landspout at the far edge of the vineyard and entering a rapid dissipation phase.||Eyewitness accounts also included the following:.|No significant winds outside of the landspout.|Ears popping as the landspout passed.|A palette spinning in the air in the landspout???s early phase.|No palette was found and no damage from the palette was reported.|Thunder was heard in the area preceding the landspout.|Brief intense heavy rain followed the landspout.|One person reported two distinct circulations; one that descended from the cloud base and another that followed which spun up off the ground.||Atmospheric and observation conditions included:.|Occurred along the leading edge of a passing cold front.|Cloud bases were estimated from eyewitness video to be around 5kft.|Radar showed showers in the area.|Lowest angle of radar beam was at about 9-10kft over the area.|Appears to be a case of low topped convection which is normal for the immediate west coast.|Wind data in the area did not show significant speeds.",00:01:00,22,22,2016,22-Apr-0016 16:01:00

Eyewitness reports from storm chasers and spotters in the area indicate that the tornado began at 6:13 pm CDT just south of Texas State Highway 176, approximately 10 miles west of Big Spring.  The tornado then moved southeastward over open fields, bounded by Natural Dam Lake to its west and Wilkinson Road just to its east.  The tornado continued on this southeast track along Salt Lake, eventually crossing Interstate 20 at approximately 6:32 pm CDT.  ||South of Interstate 20, the tornado exhibited erratic movement, being described by chasers and spotters as being nearly stationary in a field.  Examination of radar imagery showed the primary storm circulation moved slowly southeastward to approximately half a mile northwest of the intersection of Lintner Road and Rockhouse Road by 6:37 pm CDT, before turning eastward.  The tornado continued to move east, with the southern periphery of the tornado affecting Home #1.  The tornado then began to move northeastward, crossing nearly directly over Home #2 around 6:40 pm CDT.  A slight east northeast turn allowed for only the tornado's northern periphery to affect Home #3 along Cauble Road around 6:42 pm CDT.||The tornado moved southward along or near Cauble Road.  The tornado continued its erratic behavior, moving southwestward and re-entering the same field as previous around 6:48 pm CDT.  The tornado then turned west-northwestward, eventually becoming quasi-stationary just east of the Home #1 between 6:52 pm and 6:54 pm CDT, before moving westward, just north of Home #1.  Residents at home #1 described how long the tornado lasted and felt the tornado had impacted them twice. The tornado dissipated approximately 1.5 miles west of Home #1 around 7 pm CDT.||The damage assessment team looked at several different indicators to determine tornado intensity.  At Home #2, which likely was the closest and strongest structure to the tornado during the most intense portion of the tornado's life cycle, the entire roof was destroyed and exterior walls on this well-constructed residence were partially collapsed.  This damage indicator suggests an EF-3 intensity with wind speeds estimated at 140-160 mph.  In the adjacent field east of Home #2, a 640 type pump jack was blown over.  The assessment team also looked at tree damage at Home #2.  Both softwood and hardwood trees were viewed on the property.  Damage to these large trees was indicative of high end EF-2 to low end EF-3 damage.||Home #1 and Home #3 experienced tornado damage indicative of EF-2 damage.  In the examples shown, large sections of the roof were removed, but with the walls still standing.  At Home #3, there were power poles that were snapped approximately five feet off the ground.  Wind speeds at this residence are estimated at 115 to 125 mph.  At Home #1, trees were uprooted.  Wind speeds are estimated at this location of 105 to 115 mph.  The cost of damage from this tornado is a very rough estimate.",00:47:00,22,22,2016,22-May-0016 18:00:00

Winds of 60 to 70 mph were common over Hatteras Island with a peak gust of 84 mph recorded at the Duck Pier at 947 am est on September 3rd. These strong winds led to structural damage to several homes and businesses. These strong winds also pushed water from the Pamlico sound onshore leading to moderate to major sound-side storm surge of 2 to 4 feet above ground level. This storm surge flooded many homes and businesses with significant damage to some. The highest surge values of 3 to 4 feet were observed between Buxton and Hatteras Village.  On the ocean side moderate beach erosion and ocean over wash was observed damaging roads and a few homes. Very heavy rain led to some flash flooding over the Hatteras Village area and an EF0 tornado also damaged a couple cabins in the Hatteras Village community.

As water drained into the local rivers, major to record flooding occurred along the Tangipahoa River. Flooding far exceeded the 1% annual risk flood plain. Interstate 55 was closed from exit 50 to exit 53 between Fluker and Arcola due to water over the roadway.  Additionally, the entirety of Interstate 12 through Tangipahoa Parish was closed as flood crests on both the Tangipahoa and Natalbany Rivers pushed high water onto the roadway.  The end time of the event is based on when the Tangipahoa River near Robert dropped below moderate flood stage, though minor lowland flooding continued beyond this date. In all, 11,000 homes and businesses suffered various degrees of flooding throughout the parish, though it's difficult to determine how many were due to initial flash flooding and how many were due to subsequent river flooding. One fatality is attributed to the river flooding.
