Some of the more impressive 5 day totals across the parish were as follows: Stonewall: 15.42 inches, Logansport: 13.14 inches.  The Louisiana National Guard was deployed by the Governor of Louisiana to assist local law enforcement in the massive response to the prolonged flooding event. These operations included evacuations, search and rescue, distribution and supply of water and meals, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags and sandbag filling machines. In addition, 36 high water vehicles and 16 boats were called in to assist in the effort. Over 20 roads were closed during the height of the storm across De Soto Parish. Numerous high water rescues were conducted by first responders which included rescuing occupants trapped in their vehicles as well as the rescuing of residents from flooded homes across the parish. Flooding was significant for residents along Wallace Lake and the northern portions of the Toledo Bend Reservoir as well.  These reservoirs saw significant rises from the excessive heavy rainfall.  On Wallace Lake across the extreme northern border of De Soto Parish, the lake rose to 160.23 feet on March 11th which is 9.2 feet above flood stage. This was a record stage for Wallace Lake, surpassing the previous record of 159.65 feet set back in January of 1999. At this stage, numerous homes were flooded below the Wallace Lake Dam along with secondary roads towards and away from the lake were flooded as well. Flooding also closed all four north and south bound lanes of Interstate 49.  The Toledo Bend Reservoir covers the southwest border of De Soto Parish and the excessive heavy rainfall resulted in a new record crest for the Toledo Bend Reservoir.  The lake crested at 174.36 feet on March 10th which beat the previous record of 173.73 feet in May of 1989.  The lake also set an all time record release at the dam of 207,644 cubic feet per second or 1.5 million gallons of water per second.  Nine gates at the dam were open 22 feet to release this kind of water which is the highest the spillway gates have ever been opened.  Some camps and small homes along the lake shore were flooded along with numerous boat houses.  Evacuations became mandatory for residents along the River Road area, Caraway Island and the lower Garrett Park areas.  The Governor's Office of Homeland Security determined that upwards of 65 homes across De Soto Parish were completely flooded with 217 homes having registered some sort of flood damage from the 5-day event. Public property damage estimates were still pending at the time of this writing. Several Red Cross shelters were set up across the parish for flooded residents.

Numerous high water rescues were conducted by first responders which included rescuing occupants trapped in their vehicles as well as the rescuing of residents from flooded homes across the parish.  Flooding was significant for residents along Lake Bistineau as well as Dorcheat Bayou in Webster Parish.  These bodies of water saw significant rises from the excessive heavy rainfall. Lake Bistineau in the southern portion of Webster Parish set a new record stage of 150.16 feet on March 13th which broke the previous record stage of 147.79 feet in April of 1991. This resulted in severe flooding of both stilted and unstilted homes. Numerous boathouses were submerged. Nearly all access roads to the lake were cut off and travel by boat was the only practical method of transportation.  On Dorcheat Bayou at Dixie Inn, the bayou crested at 25.95 feet on March 12th which was a record crest beating the previous record of 25.12 feet in April of 1997.  At this stage, thousands of acres of land occurred.  Low parts of Dixie Inn suffered severe flooding and the restaurant and boat launch adjacent to the gauge in Dixie Inn was flooded.

Pumps were brought in to Phillip's Bayou to help efforts there.  The Tensas Basin Levee District lost one pump station near the paper mill in West Monroe.  In addition, 36 high water vehicles and 16 boats were called in to assist in the effort.

The tornado intensified as it crossed County Road 47, where a church was heavily damaged, including wall and roof failures to over half of the building. Here, the tornado was rated a low-end EF-2. Adjacent trees were also snapped and uprooted, and a few nearby homes sustained minor damage. The most chaotic scene was observed on a farmstead just east of County Road 103. At this location, a swath of trees were snapped and uprooted. Large metal farm equipment buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed. This damage was consistent with an EF-2 tornado. The tornado then weakened a bit as it moved east through the property, but continued to uproot and snap trees.

It crossed Route 62 and strengthened to an EF-1 tornado moving  through a heavily wooded area at a cemetery and between homes. All the trees were felled, many in a criss-cross pattern. Healthy hardwoods were uprooted. Other trees and softwoods were snapped. Minor damage occurred to homes protected by the much taller trees with just some shingles, flashing, and windows impacted by the wind. One guest house near Conewango Creek was destroyed when a tree demolished  it. The tornado then crossed Conewango Creek, devastating large trees around a large estate, crossing Conewango Avenue and several more properties. Again, there was some shingles and flashing lost, but most of the damage was the snapping and uprooting of trees in the path with damage to a house and garage due to fallen trees. The tornado weakened as it approached Holly Apartments and ended upon reaching a hillside behind the apartments.||Peak winds were estimated at 95 mph.

It remained a very disorganized tropical depression for a few days before the environment around it gradually became more favorable and it became a tropical storm late in the day on the 30th. Hurricane Hermine made landfall just east of St. Marks, Florida around 0130EDT on September 2 as a Category 1 Hurricane with a minimum central pressure of 982 mb, and maximum sustained winds estimated at 70 knots (80 MPH). Heavy rainfall over West-Central and Southwest Florida began on August 31 and continued through September 2, with as much as 20 inches of rain falling in some locations. River flooding from this heavy rain impacted some areas through September 6th. Storm surge generally ranged from 2 to 7 feet above normal high tide, with the highest storm surge value recorded of 7.5 feet at Cedar Key. The collective effects of Hurricane Hermine during the period of September 1-6 resulted in just over $219M in property damage, and no fatalities or injuries across West-Central and Southwest Florida. ||In Pinellas County, the highest sustained wind speed recorded was 51 knots, with a peak gust of 68 knots in the afternoon of the 1st at a home weather station at Indian Shores Beach. Storm total rainfall ranged from 6 to 20 inches between the 31st and the 2nd, with the highest value recorded of 22.11 inches at the CWOP station 1 mile SSE Baskin.

At Clearwater Beach, the peak surge was 4.41 feet on the evening of the first, and when added to the normal astronomical tide cycle, the highest storm tide was 3.99 feet NAVD88 of total water. The total damage from Hermine in Pinellas County was estimated to be $7.3 million, which includes $4 million from coastal flooding, $2.3 million from inland flooding, and $1 million from wind damage. Combining all damage sources, a total of 867 residential properties had minor or affected damage, 3 had major damage, and 5 were reported destroyed in Pinellas county.",21:00:00,1,2,2016,02-Sep-0016 08:00:00
